**Scastie is... Scala + sbt in your browser!** You can:

- use any version of Scala (scalac), or even alternate backends such as Dotty, Scala.js, Scala Native, and Typelevel Scala.
- use any library published on Maven.
- save and share Scala programs/builds with anybody

This is all possible because Scastie is based on sbt, allowing us to support newer
Scala versions and resolve library dependencies on Maven.

Scastie is an original idea from Aleh Aleshka ([OlegYch](https://github.com/OlegYch/)).
